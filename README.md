# Share me!

Share me! allows sharing selected area (full-display, left-half, center, right-half) of the screen in applications that
do not natively support this feature such as Teams.

It creates a rendering window that displays the content of the selected area. You can then share the rendering window.
The rendering window is visually covered with an overlay window to the tunneling effect.
